I'm doing it.

I'm going down the rabit hole.

Until recently, this was all just theoretical. Sketches and designs and calculations. Nothing tangible. But now I've got parts. Somehow, making a purchase brings things into reality. Now I'm commited.

I am hesitant to call it a printer, as I hate printers. They are loathesome machines, and the evilest of the modern appliances. They were created as a bridge between the analog world and the digital. They realize their impending obsolesence and make every effort to hinder our progress and cause as much misery and suffering in the time they have remaining. The paperless world of the future cannot come too soon.

In general, I think these things should be called replicators after the devices from Star Trek which inspired them. However those jerks at Makerbot already stole that name. After consulting the thesaurus, I have discovered other possible words. Fabricator, constructor, and of course, maker. Fabricator sounds industrial. Constructor vaguely reminds me of something from the old Deus Ex. Maker is a friendly and familiar term. Henceforth, I shall refer to these machines as Stuff Makers because they are makers of things.
