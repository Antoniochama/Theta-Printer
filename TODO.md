* Square nuts
* Shallower captive nut holes on the big square
* Even gear ratio on theta (so theres an even number of steps per rotation)
* tolerances (rod holes, bearing holes, captive nuts, etc.)
* Thicken frame near Z tensioners and other thin spots
* Move tensioners farther from motors so washers don't cover motor mounting bolts
* theta gear with teeth on inside, bolted to platter around perimeter, with rollers under the gear
* way to adjust theta motor position
* Arange rollers in proper tripod
* slice top off theta drive gear
* method for adjusting phase between halves of theta gear, to eliminate play
	* Use 3 layers. Horizontal screw in middle layer to adjust phase.
* deeper teeth on theta gear
* Z smooth rods are slightly longer than 400mm. add room in level 4 corners
* platter does not fit out through sides
* M3x16 bolts are not long enough to reach through corners. recommend M3x20
* Procedure for aligning level Z with smooth rods: assemble frame with 2 sides only and level z in middle. push in smooth rods through bottom. adjust level z corner nuts until rods align with level 2 holes
* Hammer smooth rods into bottom corners first.
* You doofus. The extruders collide when one moves into the center. Even when the rest are fully retracted.
* Screwdriver notches on printed parts, to easily pry them off the print surface.
* Extend endstop mount slots to the left.
* Locks that slide onto hex nuts on the arm shafts. This will hold the arms in place when not in use and hold the nuts so you can torque things for assembly/callibration.
* The platter can unscrew itself from the shaft at inconvenient times (for example, during your senior design project presentation).
* Notches in frame to allow middle section rods to be unscrewed. Or better yet, some better means for detatching/removing the Z section. How about hinged clamp things on the corner pieces so you can detatch the middle section rods.
* Z probe
* Don't make extruders out of PLA
* Bowden extruders. Imagine 4 Krakens O_o
* Threaded rods should slide freely through printed parts
* Collision switches on extruders
* Extruder arm rods should be arranged horizontally instead of vertically.
* Bed heater needs 24V PSU and probably slip ring rated for higher power.
* Bed thermistor is probably totally wrong
* Opto sensor for homeing platter. This is not critical but could be useful for restarting paused prints.
* Connect platter gear to motor with belt.
* Need some way to clean nozzles when switching extruders
* **Ditch the whole bipolar thing and rebase everything on the R-360**
	* option for independent Z axis or locked Z axis
* Motor dampers
